## Overview

This repository contains a preregistration and (eventual) data, code, and a
reproducible manuscript/supplement for a project entitled ‘Do chimpanzees revise their beliefs rationally in light of evidence?’.

Chimpanzees have the capability to monitor their own knowledge, recognizing both what they know and what they don't. When faced with uncertainty, they seek additional information, a behavior not observed when they are confident in their beliefs (e.g., Call, 2010). However, it remains unclear whether chimpanzees modulate their uncertainty levels in response to the strength of the evidence they encounter and revise their beliefs in rational ways.

In two study, our goal is to assess whether chimpanzees revise their beliefs when presented with counterevidence that is more compelling than their initial evidence; but maintain their beliefs when faced with weaker counterevidence. 

In Study 1, we provide them with two types of evidence, which have been shown to be very strong (Call, 2010) and very weak evidence in prior literature (Zeynep, Call, Seed, 2020) : conclusive visual evidence and inconclusive auditory evidence. We will test whether they revise their belief more often if they are presented with initial auditory evidence, followed by visual counterevidence, but maintain their belief if the evidence is presented in the reverse order. 

Study 2 will be added soon.
